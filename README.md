Cloud Capstone Project. Secure Data Transfer & Translation Pipeline


Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a secure, serverless data transfer and translation pipeline on AWS. It simulates the movement of data files from one system to another while translating their content into a different language in transit.

The solution leverages modern cloud-native services to ensure scalability, resilience, and automation. Infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, version-controlled with Git, and developed collaboratively in VS Code.

Business Problem
Organizations frequently need to exchange data across systems while meeting requirements such as:

Real-time processing instead of batch/manual transfers.
Data transformation or translation during the transfer process.
Security, scalability, and automation without heavy infrastructure management.

This capstone project solves these needs by building a fully automated serverless pipeline.

Solution Architecture
1. Source S3 Bucket. Incoming data files are uploaded here (representing customer/system input).
2. Amazon S3 Event Notification. Detects new files and automatically triggers processing.
3. AWS Lambda Function. Performs:
            Reading file contents.
            Translating the text into a different target language.
            Writing the translated file to the destination bucket.
4. Destination S3 Bucket – Stores the translated output files, ready for downstream consumption.
5. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) – Used to provision S3 buckets, Lambda, IAM roles, and event notifications.
6. Version Control & IDE – Source code managed in **GitHub**, developed in **VS Code** for collaboration and iteration.

Key Features
Serverless and Fully Managed. No servers to manage, scales automatically.
Real-Time Processing. Translation happens immediately when a file is uploaded.
Secure by Design. IAM policies and encrypted storage ensure security.
Automated Deployment. Infrastructure consistently deployed using Terraform.
CI/CD Ready. GitHub integration enables easy team collaboration and version tracking.

Technology Stack

AWS S3. Storage for input and translated files.
AWS Lambda. Serverless compute for translation logic.
Terraform. Infrastructure as Code.
Git & GitHub. Version control and collaboration.
VS Code. Development environment.

Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Ro-Cloud-Capstone.git
   cd Ro-Cloud-Capstone
   ```
2. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
3. Upload a file.
4. Verify translated output appears in the destination S3 bucket.

Impact
Demonstrates practical cloud adoption by re-architecting legacy file transfer processes into a modern serverless pipeline.
Proves value of automation through Terraform-based deployments.
Highlights multi-tool integration (AWS, Terraform, Git, VS Code) in delivering real-world cloud solutions.
